# Vercel Blob Local

A Docker service that mimics the Vercel Blob API locally. It lets you run
development environments and integration tests using the official
`@vercel/blob` SDK without hitting Vercel servers or triggering usage costs.

Do not install this as an npm package in your application. Instead, run it as a
standalone Docker service and point the official SDK to it using environment
variables.

Blobs are stored on disk under `/data` inside the container, which the provided
Compose file persists using a named volume. If running outside Docker, it
defaults to `.vercel-blob-local` in your current working directory,
configurable via `VERCEL_BLOB_LOCAL_DIR`.

## Docker Setup

Start the service:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run docker:up
```

Point the official SDK to your local instance by updating your app's
environment variables:

```env
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="vercel_blob_rw_local_test"
VERCEL_BLOB_API_URL="http://localhost:4545"
```

The Compose file exposes the API on `http://localhost:4545` and binds it to
`127.0.0.1` by default.

Published images:

- `ghcr.io/lafittemehdy/vercel-blob-local`
- `lafittemehdy/vercel-blob-local` once Docker Hub secrets are configured

### Authentication

API commands and private blob URLs require an
`Authorization: Bearer <BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN>` header. Public blobs can be
read freely without it.

## SDK Compatibility

The goal is a seamless local setup using standard environment variables: no
monkey-patching the SDK, modifying local DNS, or managing self-signed HTTPS
certificates.

The following features work out of the box via `VERCEL_BLOB_API_URL`:

- `put`
- `head`
- `list`
- `del`
- `copy`
- folder creation
- multipart uploads

### The `get()` Exception

The official SDK's `get(pathname)` helper generates a Vercel storage hostname,
such as `https://{storeId}.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/...`, and strictly
validates that direct URLs match this domain. Because this is hardcoded in the
SDK, `get()` cannot be routed locally using environment variables alone.

To read files during local development, fetch the direct `url` returned by
`put`, `head`, or `list` instead:

```ts
import { head } from "@vercel/blob";

const metadata = await head("wares/example.jpg");
const response = await fetch(metadata.url, {
	headers: {
		authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN}`,
	},
});
```

The local asset server handles:

- `GET` and `HEAD` requests
- bearer token validation for private blobs
- cache validation (`If-None-Match` / `304 Not Modified`)
- standard headers (`ETag`, `Last-Modified`, `Cache-Control`, `Content-Type`,
  `Content-Length`, `Content-Disposition`)
- the `?download=1` query parameter, matching `getDownloadUrl(url)` by
  returning an attachment disposition

This keeps your primary SDK interactions environment-swappable while working
around the one hostname-bound SDK limitation explicitly.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run check
pnpm run docker:build
